Workout App Inspired by a course im following but decided to add functionalites to the app

This app was inspired by an Udemy course here is the course link

The default purpose of the app was a workout app that functions linearly  so i decided to add functionalities of my own
to make the app more customizable and to fit my satisfaction of what a workout app should be like ;)

The Functionalities Added are:

Functionality to create Exercise Sessions by picking exercises to be part of the session
Save the Created Session to SqlLite Database to store the Session persistently
Allow user to pick from saved Sessions and run the exercises
Allow user to Manage their sessions such as deleting
